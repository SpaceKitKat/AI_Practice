#and random response features used by bwg2 to conduct conversation.

0B: Chuck_Norris: Yo, my name is Chuck Norris and Chuck Norris can do everything.

post your complaints to dtyfung@u.

#GRAMPS GIVES CYCLIC ADVICE FOR RELATIONSHIPS. THIS FEATURE IS DEMONSTRATED IN 
#THE FOLLOWING CONVERSATION WITH A HUMAN AGENT. DURING THE FIRST THREE QUESTIONS
#GRAMPS SAVES THE RELEVANT INFO FROM THE HUMAN IN MEMORY. HE LATER USES THIS 
#INFO TO PERSONALIZE HIS RESPONSES TO THE HUMAN.
